# Iteration 1 - Learning the Existing Codebase

## Overview
In this iteration, we explored the existing codebase and familiarized ourselves with the classes, methods, and tests already in place. The goal was to identify any bugs in the application code and debug the project until all tests passed.

## Test Failures and Fixes
1. Test: [Description of test]
   - **Failure Reason**: [Explanation of why it failed]
   - **Fix**: [Description of how the issue was resolved]
   
## Successes
- Successfully explored and understood the relationships between `Facility`, `Dmv`, and `Vehicle` classes.
- All existing tests pass after resolving bugs in the application code.

## Application Logic
- The `Dmv` class handles facilities and their services.
- The `Vehicle` class defines vehicle properties and implements methods such as `antique?` and `electric_vehicle?`.

## TDD Process
- Refactored code in small steps, ensuring tests passed after each refactor.
- Used test failures to guide debugging.

## Reflection
- **Steps to Explore Codebase**: [What you did to understand the code].
- **Challenges**: [What was difficult about working with unfamiliar code].
- **What was Easier**: [What was easier than expected].
