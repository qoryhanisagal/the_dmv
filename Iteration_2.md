# Iteration 2 - Object-Oriented Design Enhancement

## Overview
This iteration focused on improving the object-oriented design by adding the `Registrant` class. We also established relationships between classes using OOP principles.

## New Classes and Methods
- Created `Registrant` class to manage user data such as name, age, permit status, and license data.
- Added `earn_permit` method to change a registrantâ€™s permit status.

## Test Failures and Fixes
1. Test: [Description of test for `Registrant` class]
   - **Failure Reason**: [Explanation of why it failed]
   - **Fix**: [Description of how the issue was resolved]
   
## TDD Process
- Started with tests for `Registrant` and gradually built the class to meet requirements.
- Used interaction patterns to guide method design.
